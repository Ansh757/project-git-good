  1. I will primarily responsible for working on the backend of the application. Some of the major responsibilities would be to ensure the functionlity 
      of the backend functionlities of the application, this can include working on the geolocation features and creation of the admin user pages. Finally, 
      working along with the other backend developers.
      
  2. The main reason I chose this role was due to my past experience with backend development. I have completed CSC309 and found the backend portion to be
      interseting and something I was good at.
